# The-Youth-website---WordPress
Used a CMS user interface to modify and create web application content, functionality and styling. Created a custom styling theme for a CMS. Designed a front-end web application using user interface design techniques and principles.

*****Assignmnet Requirement*****
For this assignment, assume you are a web designer at a digital agency that creates websites for their customers (i.e. clients).  Create a website for the below Hamilton Youth Resources client using WordPress.

Your solution must meet the following minimum requirements:

*Contain at least 4 pages.

*Contain at least 3 posts.

*Embed a video on at least one post or page.

*Use an image on at least one post or page.

*Use a link to an external website on at least one post or page.

*Use at least two plugins.

*You must create a child theme.
The child theme must make at least 4 changes to CSS styles.
The child theme must alter at least one template of your choosing (header, footer, etc.).

You also need to design the website to (reasonably) meet the needs of the client.  In other words, the pages, theme, plugins, etc, should make sense given the description of the client provided.  This does not mean you need to write blocks of website text.  You can use lorem ipsum text to fill in website content (e.g. fake article text) as appropriate if you prefer.  But the overall design of the website (pages, what they're about, images, styling, etc.) should be done in such a way that it is well suited to this client and the potential users of the website.
